# README

## Description

This software repository contains a minimal demonstration of a Perl Dancer web
application.  The application demonstrates user registration, email
confirmation, and lost password reset.

Technology demonstrated includes:

* [Perl Dancer](http://perldancer.org) (version 1)
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and the [Mongoose](http://p3rl.org/Mongoose) ORM for Perl
* [Xslate](http://xslate.org/) template engine
* [HTML::FormHandler](http://p3rl.org/HTML::FormHandler) (and customization of it)
* [Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt](http://p3rl.org/Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt) bcrypt password hashing
* [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com/) email delivery

## Installing dependencies

The easiest way to install Perl dependencies is to install
[cpanminus](http://p3rl.org/App::cpanminus) first and run it from the checked
out repository directory.

    $ cpanm --installdeps .

You will also need to [install MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) on your
system.  (Note that as of this writing, the MongoDB Perl driver is version 0.503.3
and requires MongoDB version 2.2.2 to pass tests.  It should be OK to force install
if you have an older MongoDB.)

## Running the demo

Once all dependencies are installed, use the 'plackup' command:

    $ plackup bin/app.pl

Then browse to the web page indicated in the console, typically http://0:5000/

## Sending emails

Email sending is mocked using Postmark's test API key.  To send real email,
signup with Postmark and change the `support_email` config.yml key to an email
you have validated with Postmark, and change the WWW::Postmark plugin option
to your API key associated with the support email address.
